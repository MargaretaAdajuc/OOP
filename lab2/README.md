# LAB 2

In this lab, I created a box using 3 methods: using a constructor, a constructor with 1 variable and a constructor with 3 variables. Then, I calculated the surface area and volume of each of boxes.

The other thing that i did is creating a queue, pushed some numbers into it, then popped some of them and showed the result.
